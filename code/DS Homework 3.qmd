# Problem 1. Personal data

## a. Data summarizing

I calculated the Mean amount of money I spent on campus per day of the week. This summary allows me to compare how my spending varies depending on the day because on days that I'm on campus longer I expect to have higher spending. 

## b.Visualization

```{r}
#summarizing the mean spending by each day and naming it summary_data
summary_data <- my_data |> 
  group_by(day) |> 
  summarise(mean_spent = mean(spent, na.rm = TRUE))

#plotting data
ggplot(my_data, aes(x= day, y= spent)) +
 #making a jitter plot
   geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, color = "steelblue") + #adding specific width color and alpha to the jitterplot
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 4, color= "darkred") +#adding the mean into the jitter plot as the color red
#adding title of graph and axis
    labs(
    title = "Money Spent on Campus by Day",
    x = "Day of the Week",
    y = "Money Spent ($)") +
  # customizing the theme
  theme_minimal(base_size = 4) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size =14)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size =10)) +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size =14)) +
  theme(axis.text.y =  element_text(size =10)) +
  theme(title = element_text(size =14)) 

```

## c. Caption

Figure 1. Each point shows how much money I spent on campus each day. Red dots make the average for each day. I tend to spend more mid-week, especially on Thursday. 

## d. Table presentation

```{r}
#creating a flextable
summary_data |> #using the summay data
  rename('Day of Week' = day,#renaming day to day of the week 
         'Mean Spending($)'= mean_spent) |> #renaming mean_spent to mean spending 
  flextable() |> 
  autofit() |> 
  set_caption("Table 1. Average money spent on campus by weekday.") #creating a caption for the table
```


# Problem 2. Affective visualization

## a. Describe in words what an affective visualization could look like for your personal data

An affective visualization of this data could be a "spending spire," where each day is a ring in a circular calendar. The thickness of the ring would reflect how much i spent. It would also show how spending builds over time and could bring in the emotional data into my daily habits. 

## b. Sketch 

![Sketch](sketch.png)


## c. Visualization draft

```{r}
# Basic ring plot (conceptual)
ggplot(my_data, aes(x = day, y = spent, fill = day)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_polar() +
  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(title = "Spending Spiral: Money Spent by Day")

```
